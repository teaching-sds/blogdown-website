The following site configuration options are found in the `config.toml` file at the root of this Hugo site.

## Hugo variables

A few Hugo-defined variables are included the example site's `config.toml` file. You can find a complete list in the [Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/#all-configuration-settings). Some key ones you'll want to edit:

```toml
baseURL = "/"
title = "Hugo Apéro"
author = "Alison Hill"
# set deliberately low for testing- choose your preferred number 
paginate = 5
```

At a minimum, change these values.

## Apéro variables

The Apéro theme also defines additional site-wide, global variables. All are listed under the `[params]` section in your `config.toml` file. The most important to touch are:

```toml
[params]
  orgName = "RStudio"
  orgLocal = "Anywhere"
  description = "A modern, beautiful, and easily configurable blog theme for Hugo."
  favicon = "/img/favicon.ico"
  logo = "/img/blogophonic-mark-dark.png"
  mainSections = ["blog", "project", "talk"]
  navallcaps = true
  # Default image for social sharing and search engines. 
  # Place image file in `static` folder and specify image name here.
  sharing_image = "/img/papillons.jpg"
  # Twitter username (without @). Used when a visitor shares your site on Twitter.
  twitter = "apreshill"
```

For all image files (`favicon`, `logo`, and `sharing_image`), the files should be placed in the `/static/` folder in your project root. The default `config.toml` file shows them inside `/static/img/`, for example:

```bash
config.toml
static/
└── img/
    ├── favicon.ico 
    ├── blogophonic-mark-dark.png
    └── papillons.jpg
```

## Color themes

You have three options for customizing colors:

+ Use a [color theme](/learn/color-themes/#use-a-color-theme),
+ Use [Tachyons colors](/learn/color-themes/#use-tachyons-named-colors), or
+ Bring your own [hex codes](/learn/color-themes/#bring-your-own-hex-codes).

Find this section in your `config.toml` file and color away:

```toml
[params]
  # use a built-in color theme
  # one of: forest / grayscale / peach / plum /
  #         poppy / sky / violet / water
  theme = "peach"
  
  # or, leave theme empty & make your own palette
  # see docs at https://hugo-apero.netlify.app/learn/color-themes/
  # the custom scss file must be in the assets/ folder
  # add the filename name here, without extension
  # to use hex colors instead of named tachyons colors, include "hex" in filename
  custom_theme = "hex-colors" 
```

Read the [full docs here](/learn/color-themes/).

## Font options

You have three options for customizing fonts:

+ Use [embedded fonts](/learn/fonts/#embedded-fonts),
+ Use attractive [system fonts](/learn/fonts/#use-attractive-system-fonts), or
+ Use fully [custom fonts](/learn/fonts/#use-a-custom-font).

Find this section in your `config.toml` file and go to town:

```toml  
[params]
  # use an embedded font
  customtextFontFamily = "Commissioner"
  customheadingFontFamily = "Fraunces"
  
  # or choose a system font stack
  textFontFamily = "sans-serif"
  headingFontFamily = "serif"
```

Read the [full docs here](/learn/fonts/).

## Social icons

You can use both Font Awesome and Academicons to link to your social accounts.

Find this section in your `config.toml` file and link all the things:

```toml
[params]
  # show/hide social icons in site header & footer
  socialInHeader = false
  socialInFooter = false
  
  [[params.social]]
      icon      = "github" # icon name without the 'fa-'
      icon_pack = "fab"
      url       = "https://github.com/apreshill/apero"
  [[params.social]] <!--lather, rinse, repeat-->
```

Read the [full docs here](/learn/social/).

## Menus

Find this section in your `config.toml` file to change the menu items in the site header:

```toml
[menu]
  [[menu.header]]
    name = "About"
    title = "About Apéro"
    url = "/about/"
    weight = 1
  [[menu.header]] <!--lather, rinse, repeat-->
```

Just below the header menu, you'll find the menu items for the footer as well:

```toml
  [[menu.footer]]
    name = "License"
    title = "License"
    url = "/license/"
    weight = 1
  [[menu.footer]] <!--lather, rinse, repeat-->
```

## Check your configuration file

The blogdown R package has a checking function to help you make sure that your configuration file has all the fiddly bits right. I encourage you to use it whenever you edit this file:

```r
> blogdown::check_config()
― Checking config.toml
| Checking "baseURL" setting for Hugo...
● [TODO] Update "baseURL" to your actual URL when ready to publish.
| Checking "ignoreFiles" setting for Hugo...
○ "ignoreFiles" looks good - nothing to do here!
| Checking setting for Hugo's Markdown renderer...
○ All set! Found the "unsafe" setting for goldmark.
― Check complete: config.toml
```

We have a `[TODO]` item- we need to update our `baseURL`. To get one, we'll need to [deploy our site first](../deploy).
