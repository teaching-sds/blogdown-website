<h3>Part 1 - Teaching Observation Debrief Reflection</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve had the opportunity to debrief with your partner about your teaching observation, this assignment asks you to reflect on the process. Here are some guiding questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What were the main areas of improvement that were suggested by your partner?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there anything your partner noted about your teaching that you were surprised by or previously unaware of?</p></li>
<li><p>Recall that you started this process by thinking of a “focus question”—what will your focus question be for the next round of observations? How will you address the suggestions you received from your observation?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please answer here on bCourses in ~2 paragraphs.</p>
