The primary goal of this course is to prepare first-time GSI appointments with the skills and resources to become more confident, efficient, and effective teachers. It aims to build in students a curiosity to persistently question their practice: Why am I teaching this particular topic? What is the most important thing that my students learn? How do I know if my students have learned it? Why have I chosen to teach it in the this manner? Why are certain students engaged and succeeding and others not?

There are three integral elements to this course. In person **class meetings** are the core of the experience, when you will encounter new ideas and discuss them in the context of your current teaching. Weekly **assignments** are an opportunity to reflect on the ideas discussed in class as well as readings. **Teaching observations** will occur twice during the semester and give you the opportunity to observe a different classroom environment than your own and receive feedback about your own teaching.

## Resources

### Readings

Outside of class you'll be reading through a range of literature to inform your perspective on teaching statistics. References will be posted to the course website along with information on how to access them.

### Discussion forum

Out-of-class communication for this course will be held on [Ed](https://edstem.org).  This forum is a community space to ask and answer questions with your fellow students and course staff. It's an indispensable resource for staying up-to-date with the course and learning from your peers.

### Turning in assignments

You will be turning in weekly assignments through bCourses. This is also the platform where your assignments will be graded, so you can return there to get feedback on your work.

### Grading

This course is P/NP. A passing grade indicates that you have attended class regularly, submitted weekly assignment, and joined in two sets of teaching observations. Mid-semester, we will schedule short one-on-one meetings to discuss how your teaching is going.

## Policies

### Accomodations for students with disabilities

STAT 375 is a course that is designed to allow all students to succeed.  If you have Letters of Accommodations from the Disabled Studentsâ€™ Program or another authorized office, please share them with your instructor as soon as possible, and we will work out the necessary arrangements.

### Academic Integrity

You are encouraged to discuss your assignments with your fellow students, but the work you turn in should reflect your own understanding and all of your collaborators must be cited. Researchers don't use one another's research without permission; scholars and students always use proper citations in papers; professors may not circulate or publish student papers without the writer's permission; and students may not circulate or post non-public materials (exams, lecture recordings--any private class materials) from their classes without the written permission of the instructor.

### Scheduling Conflicts

This course is held in-person and we expect that you'll be present each week during class.

### Missing class and assignments

If you are feeling unwell, please stay home. Your health and that of the community come first. Materials for all of the course sessions will appear on the course website. Part of the weekly assignments will bear on what is discussed in class, so do your best given your absence from that discussion. If continued absence might endanger passing the class, the instructor will be in touch to discuss options.
